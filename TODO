- better error handling on datafile clashes / race conditions

- write first to temp file, then to final one? complicates a bit the
  above point

- check there are no duplicate stimulus names when loading stimulus
  file

- add possibility to have sound / image files as stimuli

- add possibility to change US to different image / sound 

- add function to show errors full screen
