Alex: Associative Learning EXperiments
======================================

Alex is a program to help running experiments on associative
learning. Rather than writing an experiment program, you write a bunch
a configuration files that describe the experiment. Alex reads these
files and, if everything goes well, runs the experiment and collects
data. An AlexManual.md is provided with the distribution.

Alex is written using PEBL (Psychology Experiment Building Language),
which you can find at http://pebl.sourceforge.net. We are indebted to
Shane Muller, PEBL's creator and maintainer, for making alex possible.

Alex is tested on most extensively on Linux, but Windows and OS X are
also tested from time to time.

Scope
-----

Alex can display squares, circles, text, and arbitrary images, and
play sound files. All of these can serve as conditioned stimuli (CSs)
or as unconditioned stimuli (USs), or, in other terms, as cues and
outcomes. Multiple CSs and USs can be presented at the same time and
CSs can be composed of arbitrary sequences or compounds of simpler
stimuli. Please refer to the manual for a full description of Alex's
capabilities.
