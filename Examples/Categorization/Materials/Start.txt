This is an example categorization task distributed with alex. 

You will see patterns belonging to one or another category and you have to learn to classify them correctly. Press 'a' to assign a pattern to category 1, and 'l' to assign it to category 2. If you classification is correct, you will see a smiley face appear. If nothing appears and the pattern simply goes away, your response was incorrect.

Please press the space bar to start the experiment.
