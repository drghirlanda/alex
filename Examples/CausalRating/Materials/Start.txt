Little Alice sometimes has an allergic reaction to food. Her parents bring her to the doctor to find out what Alice is allergic to. You are the doctor. Your task is to observe what Alice eats to find out which food or foods she is allergic to. You will first see on screen what Alice is about to eat, and then you will be able to guess whether she has a reaction or not.

Press the 'Y' key if you guess that Alice WILL show an allergic reaction.

Press the 'N' key if you guess that Alice WILL NOT show an allergic reaction.

After you guess, the actual outcome will be presented on the screen, so that you may learn which food(s) Alice is allergic to. 

The food will be shown for a few seconds only. If you do not respond fast enough, the experiment will move on and you will not know Alice's reaction.
