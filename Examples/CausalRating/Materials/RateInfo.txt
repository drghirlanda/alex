The first part of the experiment is completed. You are almost done.

Now you will be asked to evaluate, based on what you have learned so far, the likelihood that each food  causes Alice to have an allergic reaction. Use number keys 1 to 7 do indicate this likelihood, with 1 meaning a very unlikely reaction and 7 a very likely reaction.

Again, you will have a few seconds to enter your response.

Please press the space bar to start this last part of the experiment.
