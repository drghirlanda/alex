For the final portion of this experiment, you are asked to judge the probability
that the presented food or pairing of foods will cause the patient to have an
allergic reaction. Use the number keys to indicate probabilities between 0 and 1,
in the following manner:
press '1' to indicate a 0.1 probability of an allergic reaction,
press '2' to indicate a 0.2 probability of an allergic reaction,
etc.

For probabilities of 0 or 1, press 'N' or 'Y', respectively. That is,
press 'N' if there definitely WILL NOT be an allergic reaction (probability = 0);
press 'Y' if there definitely WILL be an allergic reaction (probability = 1).

Please press the space bar to continue.
