<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Alex is a program to run associative learning experiments described in configuration files. This manual describe how to configure experiments. Please refer to the README file that comes with alex for installation instructions. The README also describes in brief what alex can and cannot do.</p>
<p><a name="workflow"></a></p>
<h2 id="workflow">Workflow</h2>
<p>To build and run a new experiment you create a dedicated folder, say, MyExperiment, and within it the following subfolders:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Design</strong>: This folder contains the files that specify experimental design, such as which stimuli to use, the structure of trials, and different treatments for subjects. See <a href="#configuration-files">Configuration files</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Materials</strong>: Here you have any image, sound, or text files you need for your experiment, including an Instructions.txt file for the initial instructions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data</strong>: This folder is created by alex if it is not found, and it holds the data collected during experiment runs.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The program <code>alex-init</code> generates a bare-bones experiment so that you know what files you need. It is run like this:</p>
<pre><code>alex-init -v &lt;experiment name&gt;</code></pre>
<p>This creates folder <experiment name> with the above mentioned subfolders and skeleton configuration files.</p>

<p>Alex is written using Shane Mueller's <a href="http://pebl.sourceforge.net">Psychology Experiment Building Language</a> (PEBL). Many thanks to Shane for sharing PEBL!</p>
<p><a name="running"></a></p>
<h1 id="starting-and-stopping-alex">Starting and stopping alex</h1>
<p>From the folder where the Design and Materials folders are, you can just type 'alex'. You can also run experiments in other folders using:</p>
<pre><code>alex -v &lt;folder&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The <code>&lt;folder&gt;</code> is then expected to have Design and Materials subfolders with appropriate files. A Data folder will be create if not present.</p>
<p>Alex has been designed so that multiple instances of an experiment can be run simultaneously. This feature is useful when the experiment folder is shared among multiple computers, as it may occur in a lab. All instances of alex will read the same design files, and in particular the same <code>Groups.csv</code> file which describes how to run subjects. Different instances, however, will run different subjects and will not overwrite each other's data files.</p>
<p>The fact that a subject has been run is signaled by the existence of the corresponding data file (see <a href="#data-format">Data format</a>). If the experiment is interrupted before it completes, alex will still consider that subject as having been run. It is up to you to check that data files are complete (you can check that they have the appropriate number of lines, for example). Although this may be inconvenient at times, it is hard to improve upon this situation, because there is no way for alex to decide whether important data would be overwritten by re-running a subject. If you decide a data file is worthless, either remove it or rename it with something like an 'incomplete-' prefix, and alex will automatically re-run that subject.</p>
<p>If you want to interrupt a running experiment, you can use the standard interrupt key comination for PEBL: <code>Ctrl+Alt+Shift+\</code>.</p>
<p><a name="configuration-files"></a></p>
<h1 id="configuration-files">Configuration files</h1>
<p>All configuration files are in the Design folder:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>Phases.csv</code> describe the experimental design proper. I containes one or more experimental phases, each composed of a number of trials in which stimuli are presented, responses recorded, and outcomes delivered.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Stimuli.csv</code> defines the stimuli that are mentioned <code>Phases.csv</code>. The latter only mentions stimuli by name, while <code>Stimuli.csv</code> informs alex of what the stimuli actually are.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Groups.csv</code> defines the number of experimental groups and the treatments to which subjects in each group are allocated.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Parameters.csv</code> defines some global parameters such as screen background color, text color, font, and size, the duration of inter-trial intervals, and so on. Can also be used to define parameters that are the same for all stimuli, such as which key is used for responses.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, instruction files can be in Materials, see the <a href="#textfiles">section on text files</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-phases.csv-file">The <code>Phases.csv</code> file</h2>
<p>Suppose we want to teach participants to discriminate a red square from a white square. We then want to know how subjects respond to, say, a pink square. Table  shows how a suitable <code>Phases.csv</code> file might look like.<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> The file describes an experiment with two phases. Each line describes one type of trial that occurs in a phase. There are, for example two kinds of trials in phase 1, specifying 20 presentations of each of two stimuli, called Red and White. Red will be rewarded 90% of the time, White only 10%. On reward trials, stimulus Smiley will be displayed as the reward (US). In phase 2, stimulus Pink is presented five times. When the experiment is run, Red and White trials will be intermixed randomly because they all pertain to phase 1. Pink trials on the other hand, will be performed in phase 2 after all phase 1 trials have been run.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Phases are run in the order they are defined, not in their numerical or alphabetical order (thus you can use descriptive names like Training, Testing, etc). To be more precise, phases are run in the order in which their <em>first</em> stimuli are defined. For example, the phases file in Tables  and  are equivalent, but the file in Table  runs phase 2 before phase 1.</p>

<p>The fields in Table  should be fairly intuitive, but here is a detailed explanation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Name</strong>: An arbitrary label for the stimulus, so that it can be referenced in <code>Phases.csv</code>. It can be anything that does not contain the characters &quot; (double quote), + (plus), * (asterisk), : (colon), and , (comma). These characters are reserved for special operations described below.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Type</strong>: This can be square, circle, text, textfile, image, or sound.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Parameters</strong>: The meaning of parameters varies according to the stimulus type:</p></li>
<li><p>square: side in pixels.</p></li>
<li><p>circle: radius in pixels.</p></li>
<li><p>text: the text to be displayed.</p></li>
<li><p>textfile: name of a file in the Materials folder where the desired text is stored.</p></li>
<li><p>image or sound: name of a file in the Materials folder that contains the image or sound. An optional zoom factor can be provided to scale the image to a desired size. It should be separated from the filename by a <code>+</code> sign. The following stylized faces (smileys) come with alex and you can use them without having them in the Materials folder:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>smile-o-white.png: a happy face, as used above</p></li>
<li><p>meh-o-white.png: a neutral face</p></li>
<li><p>frown-o-white.png: a sad face</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These images are drawn in white over a transparent background; equivalent white images are available as smile-o.png, etc. All images have been taken from <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome">Font Awesome</a>, via <a href="https://github.com/encharm/Font-Awesome-SVG-PNG">this project</a>. They are 256x256 pixels in size to look OK even on high resolution monitors. If that is too big for you, yu can zoom them as indicated above.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Color</strong>: the color of squares, circles, or text. This field is ignored for images and sounds. Colors can either be named or given as an RGB triplet. As the latter are themselves comma-separated lists, they need to be double-quoted in the CSV file (spreadhseet software will do this for you). In the case of text, you can specify the background as well as the foreground color by writing the color in the form Color1+Color2, where Color1 will be foreground and Color2 the background. If no foreground or background color is given, the default set in <code>Parameters.csv</code> is used.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The PEBL reference manual lists valid color names, which are many hundreds. If you stick to simple stuff like red, blue, cyan, purple, and so on, you can get by without consulting this file. RGB, of course, enables you to define color shades more precisely.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>XOffset</strong> and <strong>YOffset</strong>: offsets from the center of the screen, in pixel. In the example, all stimuli are centered but the reward stimulus Smiley, which is displayed 150 pixels above center (&quot;above&quot; is negative Y values).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-groups.csv-file">The <code>Groups.csv</code> file</h2>
<p>The <code>Groups.csv</code> file contains information about the experimental groups you want to run. If all subjects undergo the same treatment, you only to specify one group and its size. The file in Table , for example, instructs alex to run a single groups of 10 subjects (groups can be numbered or named, as is most convenient to you). Often, however, subjects need to be divided in different treatment groups. Any of the fields in the <code>Stimuli.csv</code> file can be specified on a per-subject bases. If you want to test two shades of pink, for example, you would extend the <code>Stimuli.csv</code> file in Table . The special value <code>*</code> in the table indicates that the color of stimulus Pink will be looked up, for each subject, in the column PinkColor of the <code>Groups.csv</code> file (Table ). This syntax is available for all stimulus properties. For example, to change the size of Red square across subjects you would use the <code>Groups.csv</code> and <code>Stimuli.csv</code> files in Tables  and .</p>

<p><strong>CSDuration</strong> is the default duration of all the non-US stimuli, while <strong>USDuration</strong> is the default duration of all US stimuli. All durations are in milliseconds. Note that you can set different durations for different stimuli by including a Duration column in the <code>Stimuli.csv</code> file. When using compound stimuli, all components must have the same duration.</p>
<p><strong>CSUSInterval</strong> and <strong>USDuration</strong> should be self-explanatory.</p>
<p><strong>ReactionTimeMin</strong> and <strong>ReactionTimeMax</strong> define at what times within a trial subjects can respond. Responses outside this time window are registered with a special code (see <a href="#data-format">Data format</a>) no USs are delivered. If not specified, ResponseTimeMin is set to 0 and ResponseTimeMax to CSDuration, thus allowing responses anywhere in the trial.</p>
<p><strong>MinITI</strong> and <strong>MaxITI</strong> are the minimum and maximum values of the inter-trial interval. Each inter-trial interval will be drawn between these values with uniform distribution.</p>
<p><strong>Response</strong> is the key subjects are instructed to press if they want to respond. Note that this can also be set on a per-stimulus basis, see <a href="#responses">here</a>.</p>
<p><a name="maxresponses"></a></p>
<p><strong>MaxResponses</strong> is the maximum number of response a subject is allowed to make in one trial. There are essentially two useful settings. If you set this to 1 the trial ends with the first response (the US is delivered if appropriate, of course). If you set it to an unrealistically large value, say 1000, you can record any number of responses per trial. Each of these may result in the US being delivered, as described above. Note that you can set MaxReponses to a different value for different trial types, by including a MaxResponses column in <code>Phases.csv</code> (see the <a href="#textfiles">section on text files</a> for an example). If a MaxResponses column exists, but the value is empty for some stimuli, the MaxResponses value in <code>Parameters.csv</code> will be looked up. If MaxResponses is not set there, it is given a default value of 1.</p>
<p>The next few parameters control the screen background color while the experiment is running and the color, font, and size of text used for instructions and other messages.</p>
<p>The <strong>Test</strong> parameter, if set to 1, skips instructions and acquisition of demographic information. It is meant to quickly start the experiment during development.</p>
<p><a name="notation"></a></p>
<h1 id="more-about-stimuli">More about stimuli</h1>
<p>We mentioned above one bit of special notation in the definition of stimuli, namely the construction * (star) + stimulus name (see the end of the previous section). There are two more bits of special notation, explained next.</p>
<p>Sometimes we want some stimuli to share characteristics. For example, they should be of the same color. We can express the fact that we want a stimulus characteristic to equal that of another stimulus using a colon (:) followed by the stimulus name (we would have liked to use = rather than :, but unfortunately spreadsheet software stubbornly interprets = as introducing a formula). Consider the example above, with three squares of the same size as stimuli. The file in Table  is equivalent but uses colon notation for the Parameters field. This has two advantages: it makes explicit our intention of having three squares of equal size, and it reduces the possibility of typing errors.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The + notation is also valid for USs. This can be used to implement USs of different &quot;magnitude.&quot; For example, one can instruct subjects that each smiley face represents a point earned, and have multiple smileys appear for more valuable stimuli (this requires defining several smiley stimuli offset from each other, so that they do not overlap when displayed simultaneously). Compounding of USs may also be used to present a combination of a visual and auditory US.</p>
<p><a name="stimulus-superposition"></a></p>
<h2 id="superposition-of-stimuli">Superposition of stimuli</h2>
<p>Visual stimuli are added to the screen in the order they appear in the <code>Stimuli.csv</code> file. This means that, should some stimuli overlap on the screen, those defined <em>later</em> will be displayed <em>on top</em> of those defined earlier, obscuring them partly or wholly.</p>
<p><a name="background-stimuli"></a></p>
<h2 id="stimuli-that-are-always-present-during-a-phase">Stimuli that are always present during a phase</h2>
<p>It is sometimes desirable to have a stimulus or combination of stimuli present at all times, including inter-stimulus intervals, for example as a background on which others are superimposed. A stimulus whose name starts with &quot;Background&quot; followed by the name of a phase will be displayed for the entire duration of that phase. You can define many such stimuli, e..g, <code>BackgroundPhase1-1</code> and <code>BackgroundPhase1-2</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The rules for stimulus superposition for always-present stimuli are the same as for other stimuli, see <a href="#stimulus-superposition">Superposition of stimuli</a>. This means that if you want to use a stimulus as a backdrop for other stimuli, you have to define the stimulus before all those that are intended to appear on top of it. If the order is incorrect, the intended backdrop will instead obscure the other stimuli.</p>

<h1 id="more-about-phases">More about phases</h1>
<p>Similarly to what we have just seen about stimuli, phase parameters can be set to differ by group using the '*' and ':' notation. For example, imagine we want to investigate how discrimination learning proceeds as a function of reward probability. We could use the <code>Phases.csv</code> file in Table , which employs <code>*</code> notation for the Reward variable, and the <code>Groups.csv</code> file in Table , which provides the information that is &quot;stared&quot; in <code>Stimuli.csv</code>.</p>

<p>Note that the name of the column in <code>Groups.csv</code> is <code>TrainingAReward</code>, or, more generally, <code>(phase name)(stimulus name)(parameter)</code>. Thus the column name specifies two things: the phase and the stimulus to which the column value refers to (in doing the same things for stimuli, we had to worry only about the stimulus name). This works also to set phase parameters for a compound stimulus. For example, if you want to set the <code>Reward</code> value for stimulus <code>A+B</code>, you would use the column <code>TrainingA+BReward</code>.</p>
<p><a name="responses"></a></p>
<h1 id="responses-and-classical-vs.-instrumental-trials">Responses and classical vs. instrumental trials</h1>
<p>If we wish to record only one kind of response, e.g., space bar presses, the Response key can be specified in the <code>Parameters.csv</code> file. We can also, however, specify different responses for different stimuli by adding a Response column to the <code>Phases.csv</code> file. For example, to specify that the left arrow key is the correct response for stimulus Red, but the right arrow is correct for White, you would write as in Table .</p>

<p>Here <code>&lt;left&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;right&gt;</code> are special codes that denote the left and right arrow key. You can look up the codes for different special keys in the &quot;Keyboard Entry&quot; section of the PEBL manual. If you only want to use letter and number keys, you simply can write the letter or number as a Response.</p>
<p>There are two special response codes. One is <code>space</code>, indicating a space bar press. We made this special because the space would be hard to see when editing the CSV file.</p>
<p>The other special response code is obtained by prefixing the response with a * (asterisk). This means that the US will be displayed <em>only</em> at the end of the trial (with the appropriate Reward probability) <em>regardless</em> of what the subject does during the trial, as in classical conditioning or causal rating studies. Thus the <code>Phases.csv</code> file in Table  specifies that Red is to be rewarded 90% of the time at the end of a trial, <em>regardless</em> of whether the subject responds or not. Note that subject responses are still recorded, and if they exceed the allowed maximum the trial terminates without reward. This last feature makes it possible to implement omission training, i.e., reward subjects only when they abstain from responding. This is controlled by the <a href="#maxresponses">MaxResponses</a> parameter. The default value is 1, which corresponds precisley to omission training. If you don't want the trial to ever terminate before the allotted time, you can use a value of MaxResponses so high that it cannot be possibly reached, such as 1000.</p>

<p>Note also that on * trials, the ResponseTimeMin and ResponseTimeMax features are disabled (see <a href="#global">Global parameters</a>). Because the US (if any), is delivered only once at the end of the trial, it is irrelevant when subjects responds.</p>
<p><a name="textfiles"></a></p>
<h1 id="instructions-and-other-text-displays">Instructions and other text displays</h1>
<p>Instructions or other longish text can be displayed with the textfile stimulus type. For example, to include both a start and an end message (say a 'thank you' or similar) you can use <code>Phases.csv</code> and <code>Stimuli.csv</code> file like those in Tables  and  to include the presentation of text files that are displayed until the subject responds once. As you see in these Tables, the display of instructions is construed simply as a stimulus that stays on for a long time (here 10 minutes), unless the subject performs the required response (which, by default, is the space bar). The Start.txt and End.txt files will be looked for in the Materials folder of the experiment. Note the column MaxResponses in <code>Phases.csv</code>, which makes sure the user has to press the space bar (the default response) only once to move on, even if a larger number of responses is allowed for actual experimental trials.</p>

<h1 id="data-format">Data Format</h1>
<p>When you run an experiment with alex, data are saved in the Data folder (which alex creates if it does not find) in CSV files named with group names and subject numbers, e.g., <code>Data/Training-1.dat</code> for the first subject of group Training. These files have a header followed by one data line per response. This is so that each line identifies all variables it pertains to (so called &quot;long format&quot; in statistical software) and can be loaded easily into statistical software without having to manually add data.</p>
<p>The first few columns of each data line replicate the <code>Groups.csv</code> line for the particular subject. The remaining columns are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Sex</strong>: subject sex (collected by alex at the start of experiments).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Age</strong>: subject sex (ditto).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Phase</strong>: experimental phase the trial belongs to.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trial</strong>: trial number within the phase.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stimulus</strong>: stimulus presented in the trial (one of those defined in the <code>Stimuli.csv</code> design file).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Response</strong>: which key was designated as the correct response. Recall that <code>space</code> is a special code for the space bar and that the key may be prepended by * (asterisk) if the trial was a &quot;classical conditioning&quot; one (see <a href="#responses">here</a>).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>RewardPr</strong>: reward probability assigned to the stimulus, in case of a correct response (from the <code>Phases.csv</code> design file).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Key</strong>: Which key the subject actually pressed. This can be the correct key, or any other key that the subject may have pressed (the goal is to have a faithful record of everything the subject does).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>RT</strong>: Reaction time for this response.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ResponseCount</strong>: The number of responses in this trial, up to the current response.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reward</strong>: The reward received for the response, using the following code:</p></li>
<li><p>1: The response was rewarded (the US was presented)</p></li>
<li><p>0: The response was not rewarded (no US presented)</p></li>
<li><p>-1: The response was invalid, i.e., it fell outside of the window delimited by ReactionTimeMin and ReactionTimeMax, see above. No US is presented on such responses.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="errors"></a></p>
<h1 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h1>
<p>Errors may arise if Design files have incorrect or incomplete information. Presently, alex performs some checks at startup, but some errors are caught only as they occur while running the experiment. We advise to always run the experiment a few times before putting it into production. If you think errors are due to bugs in alex, please write us at the address in <a href="#contacts">Contacts</a>. Also do contact us if you think that your design files are correct but the experiment does not run as you expect.</p>
<p>With a few exceptions, all errors print a hopefully informative message both on the standard console output (terminal) and on screen. A few errors that may occur before the screen is set up, such as not finding necessary files, are reported only on the standard output. On Windows, these messages will appear in files <code>stdout.txt</code> and <code>stderr.txt</code>, which PEBL creates in the folder where alex is run.</p>
<p>There is one error that appears mysterious to the uninitiated: the screen remains black and alex hangs forever. The reason is that alex uses a lock system on the <code>Groups.csv</code> file to prevent concurrent instances of alex from running the same subject. The lock is held for as little as possible, but if you interrupt alex at a critical time, or if alex crashes for any reason before the lock is released, subsequent instances of alex will wait forever for the lock to be released. In these cases, you can simply delete the lock file, which is <code>Groups.csv.lck</code> in the Design folder.</p>
