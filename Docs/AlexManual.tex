\section{Introduction}\label{intro}

Alex is a program for running associative learning experiments described
in configuration files. This manual explains how to configure the
experiments. Please refer to the README file that comes with alex for
installation instructions. The README also describes in brief what alex
can and cannot do.

\subsection{Workflow}\label{workflow}

To build a new experiment you create a dedicated folder, and within it
the following subfolders:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Design}: This folder contains the files that specify
  experimental design, such as which stimuli to use, the structure of
  trials, and different treatments for subjects. See
  \hyperref[configuration-files]{Configuration files}.
\item
  \textbf{Materials}: Here you have any image, sound, or text files you
  need for your experiment, including an Instructions.txt file for the
  initial instructions (see the \hyperref[textfiles]{section on text
  files}).
\item
  \textbf{Data}: This folder holds the data collected during experiment
  runs.
\item
  \textbf{Logs}: This one holds runtime messages recorded for each
  subject.
\end{itemize}

The program \texttt{alex-init}, run as follows, generates a bare-bones
experiment with the files you'll need:

\begin{verbatim}
alex-init -v <experiment name>
\end{verbatim}

This creates folder \texttt{\textless{}experiment name\textgreater{}}
with the above mentioned subfolders (except Data and Logs, which are
created on first run) and skeleton configuration files.

Language} (PEBL). Many thanks to Shane for sharing PEBL!

\section{Starting and stopping alex}\label{running}

From the folder where the Design and Materials folders are, you can just
type \texttt{alex} in the command line. You can also run experiments in
a different folder using:

\begin{verbatim}
alex -v <path to folder>
\end{verbatim}

The folder is expected to have Design and Materials subfolders with
appropriate files. Data and Logs subfolders will be created if not
present.

Alex has been designed so that multiple instances of an experiment can
be run simultaneously. This feature is useful when the experiment folder
is shared among multiple computers, as it may occur in a lab. All
instances of alex will read the same design files, and in particular the
same \texttt{Groups.csv} file which describes how to run subjects.
Different instances, however, will run different subjects and will not
overwrite each other's data files.

The fact that a subject has been run is signaled by the existence of the
corresponding data file (see \hyperref[data-format]{Data format}). If
the experiment is interrupted before it completes, alex will still
consider that subject as having been run. It is up to you to check that
data files are complete (that they have the appropriate number of lines,
for example). Although this may be inconvenient at times, it is hard to
improve upon this situation because there is no way for alex to decide
whether important data would be overwritten by re-running a subject. If
you decide a data file is worthless, either remove it or rename it with
something like an `incomplete-' prefix, and alex will automatically
re-run that subject.

To interrupt a running experiment, you can use the interrupt key
combination for PEBL: \texttt{Ctrl+Alt+Shift+\textbackslash{}}.

\hyperdef{}{configuration-files}{\section{Configuration
files}\label{configuration-files}}

All configuration files are in the Design folder:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \texttt{Phases.csv} describes the experimental design proper. It
  defines experimental phases in terms of the stimuli, desired
  responses, possible outcomes, and number of trials in each.
\item
  \texttt{Stimuli.csv} specifies the presentation details of the stimuli
  mentioned by name in \texttt{Phases.csv}.
\item
  \texttt{Groups.csv} specifies the number and size of experimental
  groups, as well as the treatments to which subjects in each group are
  allocated.
\item
  \texttt{Parameters.csv} defines some global parameters such as screen
  background color, text color, font, and size, the duration of
  inter-trial intervals, and so on. It can also be used to define
  parameters that are the same for all stimuli, such as which key is
  used for responses.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The \texttt{Phases.csv} file}\label{the-phases.csv-file}

Suppose we want to teach subjects to discriminate a red square from a
white square. We then want to know how subjects respond to, say, a pink
square. Table \ref{phases} shows how a suitable \texttt{Phases.csv} file
might look.\footnote{In this manual, we use tables to display design
  files in a readable form. These files, however, are actually
  comma-separated-values (CSV) files. You can edit CSV files in any
  spreadsheet using the CSV format for saving. Alex wants double quotes
  (if needed) in CSV files. Single quotes will result in errors. (This
  comes from the PEBL function that reads CSV files.) Most spreadsheet
  software uses double quotes by default, but do check in case alex
  cannot read your CSV files.} The file describes an experiment with two
phases, with each line defining one type of trial that occurs in a
phase. Here, there are two kinds of trials in phase 1, specifying 20
presentations of each of two primary stimuli (S1), called Red and White.
Red will be rewarded 90\% of the time, White only 10\%. On these trials,
stimulus Smiley will be presented as the reward (S2). In phase 2,
stimulus Pink is presented five times and never rewarded.

When the experiment is run, Red and White trials will be intermixed
randomly because they all pertain to phase 1. Pink trials, on the other
hand, will be performed in phase 2 after all phase 1 trials have been
run.

\begin{longtable}[c]{@{}lllll@{}}
\caption{A simple \texttt{Phases.csv} to teach a discrimination between
stimuli Red and White, and then test responding to Pink. Note that the
S2 field can be left empty if the Reward probability is 0.

\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\pagebreak

\textbf{Note:} Phases are run in the order they are defined, not in
their numerical or alphabetical order (thus you can use descriptive
names like Training, Testing, etc). To be more precise, phases are run
in the order in which their \emph{first} stimuli are defined. For
example, the \texttt{Phases.csv} file in Tables \ref{phases} and
\ref{phases-order1} are equivalent, but the file in Table
\ref{phases-order2} runs phase 2 before phase 1.

\begin{longtable}[c]{@{}lllll@{}}

\subsection{The \texttt{Stimuli.csv} file}\label{the-stimuli.csv-file}

How does alex know that Red, White, and Pink mentioned in the
\texttt{Phases.csv} files in Tables \ref{phases}--\ref{phases-order2}
represent red, white, and pink squares, and that Smiley is a smiley
face? This information is contained in the \texttt{Stimuli.csv} file,
see Table \ref{stimuli}.

\begin{longtable}[c]{@{}llllll@{}}
\caption{A \texttt{Stimuli.csv} file instructing alex that stimuli Red,
White, and Pink are differently colored 50x50 pixel squares, and that
Smiley is an image contained in the file \texttt{smile-o-white.png}.

Smiley & image & smile-o-white.png & & 0 & -150\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

The fields in Table \ref{stimuli} should be fairly intuitive, but here
is a detailed explanation:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Name}: A label for the stimulus, so that it can be referenced
  in \texttt{Phases.csv}. This can be anything that does not contain the
  characters \texttt{"} (double quote), \texttt{+} (plus), \texttt{*}
  (asterisk), \texttt{:} (colon), or \texttt{,} (comma). These
  characters are reserved for special operations described below.
\item
  \textbf{Type}: This can be \texttt{square}, \texttt{circle},
  \texttt{text}, \texttt{textfile}, \texttt{image}, or \texttt{sound}.
\item
  \textbf{Parameters}: The meaning of parameters varies according to the
  stimulus type:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    square: side length in pixels.
  \item
    circle: radius in pixels.
  \item
    text: the text to be displayed.
  \item
    textfile: name of a file in the Materials folder where the desired
    text is stored.
  \item
    image or sound: name of a file in the Materials folder that contains
    the image or sound. An optional zoom factor can be provided to scale
    the image to a desired size. It should be separated from the
    filename by a \texttt{+} sign. The following stylized faces
    (smileys) come with alex and you can use them without having them in
    the Materials folder:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      \texttt{smile-o-white.png}: a happy face, as used above
    \item
      \texttt{meh-o-white.png}: a neutral face
    \item
      \texttt{frown-o-white.png}: a sad face
    \end{itemize}

    These images are drawn in white over a transparent background;
    equivalent black images are available as \texttt{smile-o.png}, etc.
    All images have been taken from
    \href{http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome}{Font Awesome}, via
    \href{https://github.com/encharm/Font-Awesome-SVG-PNG}{this
    project}. They are 256x256 pixels in size to look OK even on high
    resolution monitors. If that is too big for you, you can zoom them
    as indicated above.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Color}: The color of squares, circles, or text. This field is
  ignored for images and sounds. Colors can either be named or given as
  an RGB triplet, delimited by hyphens (\texttt{-}). In the case of
  text, you can specify the background as well as the foreground color
  by writing the color in the form Color1+Color2, where Color1 will be
  foreground and Color2 the background. If no foreground or background
  color is given, the defaults set in \texttt{Parameters.csv} are used.

  The PEBL reference manual lists valid color names, which are many
  hundreds. If you stick to simple stuff like red, blue, cyan, purple,
  and so on, you can get by without consulting this file. RGB, of
  course, enables you to define color shades more precisely.
\item
  \textbf{XOffset} and \textbf{YOffset}: Offset from the center of the
  screen, in pixels. In Table \ref{stimuli}, all stimuli are centered
  except for the reward stimulus Smiley, which is displayed 150 pixels
  above center (negative Y values place stimuli above center, negative X
  values place them left of center).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The \texttt{Groups.csv} file}\label{the-groups.csv-file}

The \texttt{Groups.csv} file contains information about the experimental
groups you want to run. If all subjects undergo the same treatment, you
only to specify one group and its size. The file in Table
\ref{subjects}, for example, instructs alex to run a single groups of 10
subjects (groups can be numbered or named, as is most convenient to
you). Often, however, subjects need to be divided in different treatment
groups. Any of the fields in the \texttt{Stimuli.csv} file can be
specified on a per-subject bases. If you want to test two shades of
pink, for example, you would extend the \texttt{Stimuli.csv} file in
Table \ref{stimuli-color}. The special value \texttt{*} in the table
indicates that the color of stimulus Pink will be looked up, for each
subject, in the column PinkColor of the \texttt{Groups.csv} file (Table
\ref{subjects-color}). This syntax is available for all stimulus
properties. For example, to change the size of Red square across
subjects you would use the \texttt{Groups.csv} and \texttt{Stimuli.csv}
files in Tables \ref{subjects-color-parameters} and
\ref{stimuli-color-parameters}.

\hyperdef{}{global}{\subsection{The \texttt{Parameters.csv}
file}\label{global}}

The \texttt{Parameters.csv} file contains some parameters that affect
the whole experiment. Here is a sample file (as above, the file is in
CSV format, displayed here as a table for legibility):

\begin{longtable}[c]{@{}ll@{}}
\caption{Sample \texttt{Parameters.csv} file with default
values.}\tabularnewline
\toprule

ForegroundColor & black\tabularnewline

FontSize & 36\tabularnewline
Test & 0\tabularnewline
Log & 1\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{S1Duration} is the default duration of all the S1 stimuli,
  while \textbf{S2Duration} is the default duration of all S2 stimuli.
  All durations are in milliseconds. Note that you can set different
  durations for different stimuli by including a Duration column in the
  \texttt{Stimuli.csv} file. When using compound stimuli, all components
  must have the same duration.
\item
  \textbf{S1S2Interval} is the interval between S1 offset and S2 onset.
\item
  \textbf{ResponseTimeMin} and \textbf{ResponseTimeMax} define at what
  times within a trial subjects can respond. Responses outside this time
  window are considered invalid (see \hyperref[data-format]{Data
  format}) and preclude S2 presentation. If not specified,
  ResponseTimeMin is set to 0 and ResponseTimeMax to S1Duration, thus
  allowing responses at any time during the trial.
\item
  \textbf{MinITI} and \textbf{MaxITI} are the minimum and maximum values
  of the inter-trial interval. Each inter-trial interval will be drawn
  between these values with uniform distribution.
\item
  \textbf{Response} is the key subjects are instructed to press if they
  want to respond. Note that this can also be set on a per-stimulus
  basis, see \hyperref[responses]{here}.
\end{itemize}

\label{maxresponses} - \textbf{MaxResponses} is the maximum number of
response a subject is allowed to make in one trial. There are
essentially two useful settings. If you set this to 1 the trial ends
with the first response (the S2 is presented if appropriate, of course).
If you set it to an unrealistically large value, say 1000, you can
record any number of responses per trial. Each of these may result in an
S2 being presented, as described above. Note that you can set
MaxReponses to a different value for different trial types, by including
a MaxResponses column in \texttt{Phases.csv} (see the
\hyperref[textfiles]{section on text files} for an example). If a
MaxResponses column exists, but the value is empty for some stimuli, the
MaxResponses value in \texttt{Parameters.csv} will be looked up. If
MaxResponses is not set there, it is given a default value of 1.

The next few parameters control the screen background color while the
experiment is running and the color, font, and size of text used for
instructions and other messages.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The \textbf{Test} parameter, if set to 1, skips instructions and
  acquisition of demographic information. It is meant to quickly start
  the experiment during development.
\item
  \textbf{Log} is a toggle for the logging feature, which records
  runtime messages for each subject in files named the same as
  corresponding data files, except with a \texttt{.log} suffix. Disabled
  by setting to 0.
\end{itemize}

\section{More about stimuli}\label{more-about-stimuli}

We mentioned above one bit of special notation in the definition of
stimuli, namely the construction \texttt{*} (star) + stimulus name (see
the end of the previous section). There are two more bits of special
notation, explained next.

Sometimes we want some stimuli to share characteristics. For example,
they should be of the same color. We can express the fact that we want a
stimulus characteristic to equal that of another stimulus using a colon
(\texttt{:}) followed by the stimulus name (we would have liked to use
\texttt{=} rather than \texttt{:}, but unfortunately spreadsheet
software stubbornly interprets \texttt{=} as introducing a formula).
Consider the example above, with three squares of the same size as
stimuli. The file in Table \ref{stimuli-special} is equivalent but uses
colon notation for the Parameters field. This has two advantages: it
makes explicit our intention of having three squares of equal size, and
it reduces the possibility of typing errors.

\begin{longtable}[c]{@{}llllll@{}}
\caption{A \texttt{Stimuli.csv} file demonstrating the \texttt{*} and
\texttt{:} special notations for stimuli.
\label{stimuli-special}}\tabularnewline
\toprule
Name & Type & Parameters & Color & XOffset & YOffset\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endfirsthead
\toprule
Name & Type & Parameters & Color & XOffset & YOffset\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
Red & square & 50 & red & 0 & 0\tabularnewline
White & square & :Red & white & 0 & 0\tabularnewline
Pink & square & :Red & Pink & 0 & 0\tabularnewline
Smiley & image & smile-o-white.png & & 0 & 150\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Another bit of special notation is \texttt{+} (plus), which is used to
present stimuli together (compound stimuli). Suppose that, after
training a discrimination between red and white squares, we want to test
the red and white squares together. We would then use the files in
Tables \ref{phases-plus} and \ref{stimuli-plus}.

\begin{longtable}[c]{@{}lllll@{}}
\caption{A \texttt{Phases.csv} file with a compound stimulus in phase 2.
\label{phases-plus}}\tabularnewline
\toprule

\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\begin{longtable}[c]{@{}llllll@{}}
\caption{A \texttt{Stimuli.csv} file to go with the \texttt{Phases.csv}
file in Table \ref{phases-plus}. Note that we need to offset the white
square, otherwise it would overlap with the red one when the two are
presented together. \label{stimuli-plus}}\tabularnewline
\toprule
Name & Type & Parameters & Color & XOffset & YOffset\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endfirsthead
\toprule
Name & Type & Parameters & Color & XOffset & YOffset\tabularnewline

\endhead
Red & square & 50 & red & 0 & 0\tabularnewline
White & :Red & :Red & white & 60 & :Red\tabularnewline
Smiley & image & smile-o-white.png & & 0 & 150\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\textbf{Note:} The + notation is also valid for USs. This can be used to
implement USs of different ``magnitude.'' For example, one can instruct
subjects that each smiley face represents a point earned, and have
multiple smileys appear for more valuable stimuli (this requires
defining several smiley stimuli offset from each other, so that they do
not overlap when displayed simultaneously). Compounding of USs may also
be used to present a combination of a visual and auditory US.

\hyperdef{}{stimulus-superposition}{\subsection{Superposition of
stimuli}\label{stimulus-superposition}}

Visual stimuli are added to the screen in the order they appear in the
\texttt{Stimuli.csv} file. This means that, should some stimuli overlap
on the screen, those defined \emph{later} will be displayed \emph{on
top} of those defined earlier, obscuring them partly or wholly.

\subsection{Stimuli that are always present during a
phase}\label{stimuli-that-are-always-present-during-a-phase}

It is sometimes desirable to have a stimulus or combination of stimuli
present at all times, including inter-stimulus intervals, for example as
a background on which others are superimposed. A stimulus whose name
starts with ``Background'' followed by the name of a phase will be
displayed for the entire duration of that phase. You can define many
such stimuli, e.g., \texttt{BackgroundPhase1-1} and
\texttt{BackgroundPhase1-2}.

\textbf{Note:} The rules for stimulus superposition for always-present
stimuli are the same as for other stimuli, see
\hyperref[stimulus-superposition]{Superposition of stimuli}. This means
that if you want to use a stimulus as a backdrop for other stimuli, you
have to define the stimulus before all those that are intended to appear
on top of it. If the order is incorrect, the intended backdrop will
instead obscure the other stimuli.

\section{More about phases}\label{more-about-phases}

Similarly to what we have just seen about stimuli, phase parameters can
be set to differ by group using the \texttt{*} and \texttt{:} notation.
For example, imagine we want to investigate how discrimination learning
proceeds as a function of reward probability. We could use the
\texttt{Phases.csv} file in Table \ref{phases-star-notation}, which
employs \texttt{*} notation for the Reward variable, and the
\texttt{Groups.csv} file in Table \ref{groups-phases-star-notation},
which provides the information that is ``starred'' in
\texttt{Stimuli.csv}.

\begin{longtable}[c]{@{}lllll@{}}
\caption{A \texttt{Phases.csv} using \texttt{*} notation indicating that
the value of the Reward variable given as \texttt{*Training} has to be

Note that the name of the column in \texttt{Groups.csv} is
\texttt{TrainingAReward}, or, more generally,
\texttt{(phase name)(stimulus name)(parameter)}. Thus the column name
specifies two things: the phase and the stimulus to which the column
value refers to (in doing the same things for stimuli, we had to worry
only about the stimulus name). This works also to set phase parameters
for a compound stimulus. For example, if you want to set the
\texttt{Reward} value for stimulus \texttt{A+B}, you would use the
column \texttt{TrainingA+BReward}.

\hyperdef{}{responses}{\section{Responses and classical vs.~instrumental
trials}\label{responses}}

The default Response key for all stimuli can be specified in
\texttt{Parameters.csv}. We can also, however, specify different
responses for different stimuli by adding a Response column to the
\texttt{Phases.csv} file. For example, to specify that the left arrow
key is the correct response for stimulus Red, but the right arrow is
correct for White, you would write as in Table
\ref{per-stimulus-responses}.

\begin{longtable}[c]{@{}llllll@{}}
\caption{A \texttt{Phases.csv} specifying different responses for
stimuli Red and White. \label{per-stimulus-responses}}\tabularnewline

\textless{}right\textgreater{}\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Here \texttt{\textless{}left\textgreater{}} and
\texttt{\textless{}right\textgreater{}} are special codes that denote
the left and right arrow keys. The following is a comprehensive list of
valid key codes that can be used to specify correct responses:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Characters: \texttt{a}--\texttt{z}, \texttt{0}--\texttt{9}, all
  standard punctuation (except braces, pipes, tildes, and percent signs)
\item
  Editing keys: \texttt{\textless{}space\textgreater{}},
  \texttt{\textless{}backspace\textgreater{}},
  \texttt{\textless{}tab\textgreater{}},
  \texttt{\textless{}clear\textgreater{}},
  \texttt{\textless{}kp\_enter\textgreater{}},
  \texttt{\textless{}return\textgreater{}},
  \texttt{\textless{}insert\textgreater{}},
  \texttt{\textless{}delete\textgreater{}}

  \texttt{\textless{}rshift\textgreater{}},
  \texttt{\textless{}lctrl\textgreater{}},
  \texttt{\textless{}rctrl\textgreater{}},
  \texttt{\textless{}lalt\textgreater{}},
  \texttt{\textless{}ralt\textgreater{}},
  \texttt{\textless{}lmeta\textgreater{}},
  \texttt{\textless{}rmeta\textgreater{}},
  \texttt{\textless{}numlock\textgreater{}},
  \texttt{\textless{}capslock\textgreater{}},
  \texttt{\textless{}scrollock\textgreater{}}
\item
  Navigation, function keys: \texttt{\textless{}up\textgreater{}},
  \texttt{\textless{}down\textgreater{}},
  \texttt{\textless{}left\textgreater{}},
  \texttt{\textless{}right\textgreater{}},
  \texttt{\textless{}home\textgreater{}},
  \texttt{\textless{}end\textgreater{}},
  \texttt{\textless{}pageup\textgreater{}},
  \texttt{\textless{}pagedown\textgreater{}},
  \texttt{\textless{}esc\textgreater{}},
  \texttt{\textless{}f1\textgreater{}}--\texttt{\textless{}f15\textgreater{}}
\end{itemize}

Responses can also employ \texttt{*} notation. Prefixing a specified
response with an asterisk means that the US will be displayed
\emph{only} at the end of the trial (with the appropriate Reward
probability) \emph{regardless} of what the subject does during the
trial, as in classical conditioning or causal rating studies. Thus the
\texttt{Phases.csv} file in Table \ref{classical} specifies that Red is
to be rewarded 90\% of the time at the end of a trial, \emph{regardless}
of whether the subject responds or not. Note that subject responses are
still recorded, and if they exceed the allowed maximum the trial
terminates without reward. This last feature makes it possible to
implement omission training, i.e., reward subjects only when they
abstain from responding. This is controlled by the
\hyperref[maxresponses]{MaxResponses} parameter. The default value is 1,
which corresponds precisley to omission training. If you don't want the
trial to ever terminate before the allotted time, you can use a value of
MaxResponses so high that it cannot be possibly reached, such as 1000.

\begin{longtable}[c]{@{}llllll@{}}

\end{longtable}

Note also that on * trials, the ResponseTimeMin and ResponseTimeMax
features are disabled (see \hyperref[global]{Global parameters}).
Because the US (if any) is delivered only once at the end of the trial,
it is irrelevant when a subject responds.

\hyperdef{}{textfiles}{\section{Instructions and other text
displays}\label{textfiles}}

Instructions or other longish text can be displayed with the textfile
stimulus type. For example, to include both a start and an end message
(say a `thank you' or similar) you can use \texttt{Phases.csv} and
\texttt{Stimuli.csv} file like those in Tables \ref{phases-instructions}
and \ref{stimuli-instructions} to include the presentation of text files
that are displayed until the subject responds once. As you see in these
Tables, the display of instructions is construed simply as a stimulus
that stays on for a long time (here 10 minutes), unless the subject
performs the required response (which, by default, is the space bar).
The Start.txt and End.txt files will be looked for in the Materials
folder of the experiment. Note the column MaxResponses in
\texttt{Phases.csv}, which makes sure the user has to press the space
bar (the default response) only once to move on, even if a larger number
of responses is allowed for actual experimental trials.

\hyperdef{}{data-format}{\section{Data Format}\label{data-format}}

When you run an experiment with alex, data are saved in the Data folder
(which alex creates if it is not found) in CSV files named with group
names and subject numbers, e.g., \texttt{Data/Training-1.csv} for the
first subject of group \texttt{Training}. These files have a header
followed by one data line per response. This is so that each line
identifies all variables it pertains to (so called ``long format'' in
statistical software) and can be loaded easily into statistical software
without having to manually add data.

The first few columns of each data line consist of the hostname,
followed by the group, subject number, and pertinent treatments as
specified in the \texttt{Groups.csv} line for the particular subject.
The remaining columns are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Sex}: Subject's sex (collected by alex at the start of
  experiments, otherwise \texttt{NA}).
\item
  \textbf{Age}: Subject's age (ditto).
\item
  \textbf{Time}: Time when response was made (since start of experiment,
  in ms).
\item
  \textbf{Phase}: Experimental phase the trial belongs to.
\item
  \textbf{Trial}: Trial number within the phase.
\item
  \textbf{S1}: Designated S1 for this trial (defined in
  \texttt{Stimuli.csv}), or \texttt{ITI} for responses registered
  between trials.
\item
  \textbf{S1Duration}: Duration of S1 (or inter-trial interval).
\item
  \textbf{S1On}: Was S1 present when the response was made? (\texttt{T}
  for true, \texttt{F} for false --- as in the case of responding during
  an S1--S2 interval.)
\item
  \textbf{S2}: Designated S2 for this trial (\texttt{NA} if not
  specified in \texttt{Phases.csv} and during ITIs; \textbf{S2Duration},
  \textbf{S2Prob}, and \textbf{Response} are also \texttt{NA} in these
  cases).
\item
  \textbf{S2Duration}: Duration of S2.
\item
  \textbf{S2On}: see \textbf{S1On}.
\item
  \textbf{S2Prob}: Probability of S2 presentation, given a correct
  response (both specified in \texttt{Phases.csv}).
\item
  \textbf{Response}: Key designated as the correct response. Recall that
  the key may be prepended by * (asterisk) if the trial was a
  ``classical conditioning'' one (see \hyperref[responses]{here}).
\item
  \textbf{RT}: Response time since start of trial (\texttt{NA} if trial
  timed out).
\item
  \textbf{Valid}: Was the response made during a trial, within the
  window delimited by ResponseTimeMin and ResponseTimeMax? (\texttt{T}
  or \texttt{F}).
\item
  \textbf{Key}: Subject's actual response. This can be the correct key,
  any other key the subject may have pressed, or
  \texttt{\textless{}timeout\textgreater{}} in the case of no responses
  within a trial (the goal is to have a faithful record of everything
  the subject does).
\end{itemize}

We believe this information characterizes subject behavior competely,
but please do let us know if you think details could be added.

\section{Troubleshooting}\label{troubleshooting}

Errors may arise if Design files have incorrect or incomplete
information. Presently, alex performs some checks at startup, but some
errors are caught only as they occur while running the experiment. We
advise to always run the experiment a few times before putting it into
production. If you think errors are due to bugs in alex, please write us
at the address in \hyperref[contacts]{Contacts}. Also do contact us if
you think that your design files are correct but the experiment does not
run as you expect.

With a few exceptions, all errors print a hopefully informative message
both on the standard console output (terminal) and on screen. A few
errors that may occur before the screen is set up, such as not finding
necessary files, are reported only on the standard output. On Windows,
these messages will appear in files \texttt{stdout.txt} and
\texttt{stderr.txt}, which PEBL creates in the folder where alex is run.

There is one error that appears mysterious to the uninitiated: the
screen remains black and alex hangs forever. The reason is that alex
uses a lock system on the \texttt{Groups.csv} file to prevent concurrent
instances of alex from running the same subject. The lock is held for as
little as possible, but if you interrupt alex at a critical time, or if
alex crashes for any reason before the lock is released, subsequent
instances of alex will wait forever for the lock to be released. In
these cases, you can simply delete the lock file, which is
\texttt{Groups.csv.lck} in the Design folder.

Please send suggestions to improve alex or this manual to Stefano
Ghirlanda, drghirlanda@gmail.com.
